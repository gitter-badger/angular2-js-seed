# angular2-seed

This Project uses `browserify` and `gulp` to bundle the angular application and give it a node-like modularity, Typescript is a good tool but I am fan of it.

This initial application includes twitter bootstrap4, tether and jquery. 

## Usage

Clone or fork this repository and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

```lang:bash
npm start
```

then open this url:
[`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

To just compile a compressed version of the application without dev server, run the following command:

```lang:bash
npm run build
```
